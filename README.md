# DSA-JAVA_Assignments
This repository contains Java solutions for two assignments that showcase core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts:

1. IceDataAnalysis (3D Array Analysis)
- Analyzes ice sheet data using 3D arrays to identify weak spots and cracks.
- Demonstrates multidimensional data handling, iteration, and search techniques.

2. Battleship Bot
- This bot simulates 10,000 games of Battleship on a 144-grid and efficiently finds all 6 ships with sizes (5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 2). Using a combination of arrays and ArrayLists, the bot locates all ships in an average of 66.5 hits per game.
